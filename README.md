## HR analytics trends.
In this project, I received from my employer a HR analytics dataset. I was asked:
* To clean this dataset
* To use data visualization tools and techniques to trends between different variables.
He wanted to anticipate about **turnover concerns** and understand the feelings of his employees in order to adjust efficently productivity and retention rate.

In this report, we will see:
* A dashboard overview of every trend that I found out from this dataset.
* A dashboard of different relationships between variables.
These results showcased my ability to use **spreadsheet, SQL and Power BI** to complete a data analysis project.
